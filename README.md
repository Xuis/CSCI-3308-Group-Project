## Project Description
	Project Name: Birdbox (or, BRDbox - Bird Registration Database box)

	This application will provide users with access to a database of birds to assist in identification.
	The birds will be filtered and ranked based on user selections of set select criteria. The database
	will include information about not only the bird's name, but size (including length) as well as colors
	and other notable features. The user will be prompted for these selection to help to narrow down the
	correct bird. The user will first be prompted to choose from array of sizes (xsmall, small, average,
	medium, large, xlarge). Then, choose from a selection of colors as well as any other notable features
	like long legs or necks. Finally, after all this information is collected from user inputs the
	database will use this information to filter through all possible choices. Finally, after sorting and
	ranking possible choices, the most likely candidate bird species is displayed for the user, along with
	around a dozen alternate (but similar) choices. This display will include some basic information about
	the bird, like life span or egg color and behavior along with a picture to identify. In addition, the
	database will include information about easily confused pairs (like crows and ravens) to help the user
	to distinguish easily confused birds.
	Also, with the opportunity to expand the databse, there will be an option for a form that users can
	fill out for curated submissions (based on the moderator's discretion). This will include the ability
	to pin a user's location for identification to count and collect sightings.

## Vision Statement
	To provide competitive user-centered access to avian knowledge

## Motivation
	As it stands, the most traditional method to identify birds is bulky 800+ page paper field guides.
	This can be very difficult for an inexperienced user to encounter when most users just want to identify
	a bird they see on a trial or out their window. To add to the difficulties, most guides do not have a
	quick and accessible way to find what the user is looking for. Birds are everywhere, but for the many
	budding ornithologists that may not always find a clear way to translate what one may be looking at
	into terms defined in a field guide.

## Risks
	1. Choosing the best traits to characterize birds with
		-Needs to be unique enough for the database to properly filter with

	2. Choosing an appropriate scale for the project
		-There are approximately 10,000 species of birds

	3. Not having an effect and user-friendly user interface

## Risk Mitigation Plan
	1. Keep functionality small and build if time permits
		-Start locally and add to regionally
		-Keep search paramters simple
		-Add parameters or additional information for each species as time allows

	2. The user entry system is a high priority
		-Lots of user testing for each stage

	3. Contact experts to understand what kind of identifiers they use

## Software Development Methodology
	Agile will be the most useful for this project. In particular, with bi-weekly milestones to meet this
	will allow for quick turn over between each stage. In addition, this will help to ensure that there is
	enough time to have user input and user testing. There are six members in this group and for each part
	of the project we will be implementing pair programming. This way for any part of the project there will
	be at least two people that know what is happening in the code. This will ensure that there will be no 
	unexpected delays if anyone is sick or has other unexpected oblgiations.
